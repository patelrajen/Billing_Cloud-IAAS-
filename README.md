===================

Cloud computing is the new paradigm that has changed traditional computer business schemes. And Infrastructure as a service is base of all parts of cloud computing. Here we focus on Efficient Cloud Usage metering which helps a consumer and provider. Classic solution of cloud usage metering is fail to provide actual usage information to consumer as it is given on basis of hours and days. And at the same time cloud provider cannot judge the usage of consumers. So sometimes power consumption for cooling servers and for computing is wasted. And more use of power also affects the environment. Our cloud usage metering provide efficient metering of every seconds usage of cloud resources so consumer need to pay as they use or aware about their actual usage. And provider can analyse from the cloud resource usage graph of consumers and as per their analysis they manage their resources.
